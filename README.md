# Zenbot

My first Discord bot for me to learn python and discord.py

Feel free to submit pull requests and issues here or use the z.feedback command

I stopped development on zenbot since discord.py got deprecated. I'm not that interested in coding for a discord bot that much anymore, but I may come back to this

I'm fine with anyone forking or creating their own version as long as it isn't for profit and I am credited.
